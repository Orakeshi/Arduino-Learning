Electrical components that are used to limit current.

Its important because we don't want to damage other components due to current overflow

Ohm's Law

$$V=IR$$
$V$ = Voltage ($V$)
$I$ = Current ($A$)
$R$ = Resistance ($Î©$)

$R$ is measured in Amptures

LED has maximum limit of 20ma. If we go over that, it will break LED (Fry It)

Ohm's law helps us calculate to prevent frying LED.

In example above the battery outputs 5V, so:
$$5V = 15mA*R$$
